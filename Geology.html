        <h2>Geology</h2>
        <p>Geology is the scientific study of the Earth, its solid rocks, the processes that shape its surface, and the history of its formation. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics to understand the Earth's structure, composition, and the dynamic processes that have shaped it over billions of years.
	  </p>
	  <p>Geology explores the materials that make up the Earth, including rocks, minerals, and the layers of sediment that form its surface. It investigates the forces that have shaped the Earth's features, such as mountains, valleys, and plate tectonics.</p>
	  <p>The study of geology involves various sub-disciplines. Structural geology examines the deformation of rocks and the forces that cause them to fold, fracture, and move. Petrology focuses on the origin, composition, and classification of rocks, while mineralogy studies minerals and their properties.</p>
	  <p>Geology also plays a crucial role in understanding Earth's history. By studying rocks, fossils, and other geological evidence, geologists reconstruct the Earth's past environments, climate changes, and the evolution of life on our planet.</p>
